	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/jquery.engage.css">


After you can instanciate the plugin on the article container:

## Options
The options shown below are the current default:

	<script>

            offset: 0, // change position
            scrollhide : false // hide when the user scroll back to the top of the article
            contents : ["comment","share", "newsletter"], // content shown in the toolbar
            newsletter : {
            	url : "http://www.mailchimp.com/mylisttoken" // url where the form will submit
            },
            share: :{
            	buttons : ['linkedin', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'reddit'], // share links shown
            	title : document.title, // default shared title
            	url : location.href // default shared link
            },
            // text example
            comment : {
            	url : "/wp-comments-post.php",
	            text : {
		            defaults : {
		                title : "Have your say!",
		                thanks : "Thank you for contributing, your comment will be added shortly."
		            },
		            morning : {
		                title : "Morning! Have some opinions on this article?",
		                thanks : "Thank you for contributing, your comment will be added shortly."
		            },
		            night : {
		                title : "Have your say!",
		                thanks : "Thank you for contributing, your comment will be added shortly."
		            }
		        }
		    }
        };
	</script>

### Offset (int)

Help you better position when the toolbar is shown, negative number are allowed. This is particulary useful when dealing with margins.


### contents (array)

Content zone shown into the toolbar by order. There is a maximum of 3 zones shown at the same time (2 or 3).  



### Changing text

The plugin allow customized text depending of the time of the day, this can help you optimize users engagement by better connecting with the user.

Each content type can be customized like shown above. Check all the text options in the content js file in the contents folder.

## Connecting newsletter subscription to mailchimp, cakemail, etc.

The comment plugin take a url option where the form will be posted. I do not provide an ajax function for now, but there is a mailchimp wrapper included with this plugin.

## Creating other content

Adding other content types like bookmark or related article is easy. First add a js file in the contents folder, you can use the comment plugin as a reference, here how to namespace it.

	$.engage.contents.yourname


When launching the plugin to not forget to add your content name to the options.

	<script>$(".article").engage({contents: ['yourname','newsletter']});</script>

### The init(time)

When the script load your content it will call the *init()* method.  The options are automatically passed to your plugin, you can retrieve them using *this.options*. The time (string, "morning", "night", "default") is given as parameter to the init function so you can use this information to better target your text.

You *must* return the parsed html content to the init function.

### Events helper

There are 3 chatchable events for your plugin.

engage.show // when the toolbar is shown
engage.hide // when the toolbar is hided
engage.destroy // when the plugin is destroyed

### Adding your new content to the minified file

You can always simply add your file below the plugin in the html document like this:

	<script src="js/jquery.enagage.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
	<!-- below is the google analitycs plugin -->
	<script src="js/contents/name.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

Or you can minify it using grunt, first *load npm install* to install dependencies, then just do grunt and it's all automatic. You must comply with jslint before a compilation is completed. If that sound complicated please check gruntjs, it should be simple to pick it up from there.
